# Indigio

Indigio is an open source chatting app, and it's available on the web and as a desktop application.

## Deployment

Indigio will eventually be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). As of now, there are no stable releases, so the app has not been deployed.

## Security concerns

At the moment, the application is not as secure as it should be. It is not recommended that it be used for secure communication. In the future these security issues will be fixed.
