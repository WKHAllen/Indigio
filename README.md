# Indigio

Indigio is an open source chatting app, and it's available on the web and as a desktop application.

## Deployment

Indigio will eventually be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). As of now, there are no stable releases, so the app has not been deployed.

## Where it works

The app has been tested in multiple browsers. It works best in Chrome and Electron. In Edge and Firefox it works moderately well. It does not work at all in Internet Explorer, but IE is completely outdated at this point, so no one should be using it anyway.

In the future, it will be tested in Safari as well.

## Security concerns

At the moment, the application is not as secure as it should be. It is not recommended that it be used for secure communication. In the future these security issues will be fixed.
