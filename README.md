# Indigio

Indigio is an open source chatting app, and it's available on the web and as a desktop application.

## Deployment

Indigio is currently deployed on Heroku [here](https://indigio.herokuapp.com/). Several problems still exist, so it may take a bit of time before Heroku is able to fully deploy it.

## Browser Compatibility

The app has been tested in multiple browsers. It works best in Chrome and Electron. The only problem in Firefox and Edge is that the scrollbars seem not to be styled. It does not work at all in Internet Explorer, but no one should be using IE anyway.

In the future, it will be tested in Safari as well.

It is highly recommended that users use Chrome if the desktop app is not preferable.

## Security concerns

At the moment, the application is not as secure as it should be. It is not recommended that it be used for secure communication. In the future these security issues will be fixed.
