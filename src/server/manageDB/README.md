# Database Manager

This is a small Python script that exposes the database to developers. It is designed to make debugging and testing easier.

## Usage

To use it, simply run the following command:

```console
$ python manageDB.py
```

A local webserver will run on port 5000, and the database management page will be opened in the default browser.

## Requirements

The database manager requires [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) to create and host the webpage.
