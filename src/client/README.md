# Indigio Client

The client side to this project is minimal. This directory contains a very basic electron app. That's it. The electron app isn't even necessary, as users can access the application through a web browser. The electron app simply provides a desktop environment for the application.

## Usage

First, install the requirements using npm:

```console
$ npm install
```

Then run it:

```console
$ npm start
```
