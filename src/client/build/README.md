# Packaging the App

The `build.js` script packages the app for distribution and creates an installer for it. The packaged app and the corresponding installer will be created based on the platform the script is run on. The script will attempt to do this for all available architectures for the given platform.

## Usage

To run the script, simply do:

```console
$ npm start
```
